# Feature Specification: GuitarAccuracy macOS App with Metronome

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-guitar`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a guitar accuracy application for Macos that can be built in xcode   Do not use any IOS specific code. The application will have a metronome with an adjustable BPM slider and will produce a metronome click.  The user will be able to select rhythmic patterns of quarter note, eighth note, eighth note triples, sixteenth notes, sixteenth note triplets.  The metronome should click with the correct note type and BPM chosen. The GUI should be modern looking"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a guitarist practicing timing, I want a desktop metronome that lets me set BPM and choose rhythmic subdivisions so I can hear accurate clicks for the selected pattern and improve my rhythmic accuracy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the app is launched, when the user sets BPM to 120 and selects quarter notes, then the metronome outputs audible clicks at 2.0 Hz (2 clicks per second) when started, and stops immediately when stopped.
2. Given BPM = 120 and the user selects eighth notes, then the metronome outputs 4.0 Hz (4 clicks per second) when started, matching the subdivision rate.
3. Given BPM = 120 and the user selects eighth-note triplets, then the metronome outputs 6.0 Hz (6 clicks per second) when started, evenly spaced within the beat.
4. Given BPM = 120 and the user selects sixteenth notes, then the metronome outputs 8.0 Hz (8 clicks per second) when started.
5. Given BPM = 120 and the user selects sixteenth-note triplets, then the metronome outputs 12.0 Hz (12 clicks per second) when started.
6. Given the metronome is running, when the user adjusts the BPM slider continuously from 60 to 180, then the click rate updates smoothly within 250 ms to reflect the new BPM and remains timing-accurate.
7. Given the metronome is running, when the user switches rhythmic patterns, then the click rate changes immediately (‚â§250 ms) to the correct new subdivision without audio glitches.
8. Given system output is muted or unavailable, when the user starts the metronome, then the app displays a non-blocking notice that audio output is unavailable.

### Edge Cases
- BPM at lower bound (e.g., 20 BPM) and upper bound (e.g., 300 BPM) remains stable and accurate.
- Rapid toggling start/stop does not crash or drift timing.
- Switching patterns rapidly while running maintains continuity and avoids overlapping clicks.
- App window resize and dark mode changes do not affect timing.
- System sleep/wake while the app is open does not leave the app in an inconsistent state; playback stops predictably.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The user MUST be able to set BPM via a slider and/or numeric input. Supported range MUST include at least 20‚Äì300 BPM with 1 BPM granularity.
- **FR-002**: The user MUST be able to select rhythmic patterns: quarter notes, eighth notes, eighth-note triplets, sixteenth notes, sixteenth-note triplets.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST produce an audible click that matches the selected BPM and rhythmic subdivision when the metronome is started, and be silent when stopped.
- **FR-004**: While running, changes to BPM or pattern MUST take effect within 250 ms without audible glitches.
- **FR-005**: The UI MUST provide start/stop controls and a clear visual state indicating whether the metronome is running.
- **FR-006**: The GUI MUST present a modern, clean layout consistent with desktop usability expectations.
- **FR-007**: The application MUST be buildable and runnable on macOS via the Xcode GUI and command line.

*Additional clarifications to confirm with stakeholders:*
- Visual beat emphasis (e.g., accented first subdivision) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
- Volume control and sound selection [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
- Persistence of last-used BPM and pattern across launches [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MetronomeSettings**: BPM (integer), Pattern (enum: quarter, eighth, eighthTriplet, sixteenth, sixteenthTriplet)
- **PlaybackState**: isRunning (bool), lastStartTime (timestamp)

## Platform & Compliance Constraints (macOS) *(recommended)*
- **Target macOS version(s)**: 14+ (Sequoia) or as defined by project constraints.
- **Distribution channel**: Direct notarized distribution (App Store optional) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
- **User privacy considerations**: No personal data collected; audio output only.
- **Accessibility expectations**: Keyboard shortcuts for start/stop; controls accessible via VoiceOver; clear focus order.
- **Localization scope**: English baseline; additional locales [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
- **Security constraints**: App Sandbox enabled; no elevated entitlements required beyond standard audio output.
